# Frontend

In this frontend we leverage `React` for all the rendering. We also user `OvermindJS` for state management and `ApolloClient` for `GraphQL` interactions.

I think `ApolloClient` could be replaced with the `OvermindJS GraphQL` that is something to checkout and try.

# Environment

copy the `.env.example` to `.env.local` and replace values to fit your needs.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `yarn start` will start the project on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `yarn test` learns the test runner
- `yarn build` builds the app for production
- `yarn eject` will let you eject react (can't go back)
